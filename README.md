# parallelized-reservoir-computing
This repository contains code for parallelized prediction of spatiotemporal chaotic data using reservoir computing as described in the paper: Model-Free Prediction of Large Spatiotemporally Chaotic Systems from Data: AReservoir Computing Approach (Physical Review Letters, 120, 024102 (2018)). 


I may or may not have time to respond to or help with issues. This code has been provided as is. As I find time, I will try to make it more user-friendly and readable. This code was written by me, Jaideep Pathak with inputs and pointers from colleagues and friends at the University of Maryland, College Park. I worked on this code during my PhD and I have since graduated and started a Postdoctoral research position.
